Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the lack of tools for widely monitoring air quality in indoor public spaces, enabling data-driven decisions in everyday life, 
as they can play a significant role in abating the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2virus. Even actions as simple as opening doors and windows to ventilate rooms
are widely known to be highly effective, and they may be further beneficial if triggered depending on a proper evaluation of indoor air quality levels. However,
several online systems currently available on the Web mainly provide theoretical indoor air quality estimations without adequately exploiting IoT-supplied data
streams. To tackle such issues, this paper describes a smart service for alerting when the air quality conditions become critical for SARS-COV-2 propagation. 
It is based on a cyber-physical-social platform, enabled by IoT devices that monitor air quality components, elaborates over the collected samples to infer the
risk of SARS-COV-2 propagation. The result of the process alerts enabled users.
